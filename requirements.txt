--Core Scientific and Mathematical Libraries
NumPy: Efficient numerical computations, especially with arrays and matrices.
Pandas: Data structures and data analysis tools, great for data cleaning and preprocessing.
SciPy: Scientific computations, including statistics, linear algebra, and signal processing.
Matplotlib: Creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
Seaborn: Advanced visualization library built on Matplotlib.

--Machine Learning Libraries
scikit-learn: Variety of machine learning algorithms for model training, evaluation, and data preprocessing.
XGBoost: Efficient machine learning algorithm implementation, great for tabular data.
TensorFlow or PyTorch: Deep learning frameworks for building and training complex neural network models, including PINNs.  
Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
Scikit-learn: Also provides tools for data preprocessing and feature selection.
Polynomial Features: For generating polynomial and interaction features, extendable with scikit-learn.

--Model Persistence
Joblib: Serializes Python objects, especially large numpy arrays, often used for saving and loading models.
Python Pickle: Python's built-in serialization library for persisting Python objects.

--Jupyter Notebook
Jupyter: Provides an interactive computing environment, ideal for project development and documentation.

--Optional Libraries for Advanced Features
Keras: High-level interface for TensorFlow, simplifies the building and training of deep learning models.
Plotly: For creating interactive charts, enhancing the interactivity of data visualization.
These dependencies cover the spectrum of tasks involved in a typical machine learning project, from data manipulation and visualization to model development and persistence. Including them in a requirements.txt file ensures that others can replicate your environment easily.
