Project Title: Predicting Plant Uptake of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) from Hydroponics Using Machine Learning Models

Brief Description:
This project utilizes machine learning to predict the root uptake of PFAS by plants in hydroponic systems. The goal is to understand key factors influencing PFAS uptake and to offer insights into PFAS bioavailability in crops, crucial for environmental risk assessment and food safety.

Project Objectives:
Master data preprocessing techniques to enhance data quality.
Learn model tuning methods to achieve optimal parameter settings.
Understand the principles and applications of various machine learning models.
Develop a high-accuracy predictive model for PFAS uptake in plants.
Analyze the performance and applicability of the model in real-world scenarios.
